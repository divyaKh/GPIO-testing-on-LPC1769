# GPIO-testing-on-LPC1769
In this project, we have developed a prototype to test the General Purpose Port interface of the LPC1769 module. The aim is to toggle an LED connected to an output port of LPC1769 by changing the state of a switch, connected at the input port. The key in t his project is to correctly read and write to I/O pins of LPC1769.
